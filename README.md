# Weather Prediction
Rain is one of the natural phenomena that often occurs in various parts of the world. Generally, there is no definite time when it will rain, so it is quite difficult to predict whether it will rain or not. Because the process of rain is erratic. Therefore we created a simple Artificial Neural Network model that can predict whether it will rain or not in the next day.
